STATEMENTS

C++ provides you with tools which helps you to control the way your program behaves (logic flows) 
based on how the user interact with your program. Here we will discuss about if-else, 
switch and goto are three common ways to guide the flow of logic in your code.


LOOPS

Loops are an essential concept in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly 
until a specific condition is met. In C++, there are three main types of loops: for, while, and do-while.

- For

	A for loop is used when you know the number of times you want to traverse through a block of code. 
	It consists of an initialization statement, a condition, and an increment/decrement operation.

	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
		// block of code to execute
	}

- While

	A while loop runs as long as a specified condition is true. 
	The loop checks for the condition before entering the body of the loop.

	while (condition) {
		// block of code to execute
		// increment/decrement
	}

- Do-While Loop

	A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, with the key difference being that 
	the loop body is executed at least once, even when the condition is false.

	do {
		// block of code to execute
	} while (condition);
